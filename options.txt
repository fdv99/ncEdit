Open both the input file and a new output file (as a TextReader/TextWriter, e.g. with File.OpenText and File.CreateText)
Read a line (TextReader.ReadLine) - if you don't want to delete it, write it to the output file (TextWriter.WriteLine)
When you've read all the lines, close both the reader and the writer (if you use using statements for both, this will happen automatically)
If you want to replace the input with the output, delete the input file and then move the output file into place.
